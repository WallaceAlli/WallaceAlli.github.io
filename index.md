# The Purpose of Pick Up Pal
Pick Up Pals (PUP) is a app that streamlines schoolâ€™s child pick up systems by making the parent/gaurdian verification system more efficient while also making child pick up more safe. PuP will save verification information of parents and gaurdians, like driver license and car information, as well as who the parent and guardian is allowed to pick up. PuP will also save a black list of individuals that can not, for one reason or another, pick kids. 

When a parent or gaurdian gets in line to pick up there kids, they open PuP and select which kids (of the ones they are allowed to pick up) they are picking up today. PuP will then generate a QR code on there device. A teacher will then scan the parents QR code. Once scanned the teachers device will pull up the parent/gaurdians information and verify the person is who they say they are. The Teacher will then press a button that puts the parent in the bottom of the queue. Once the parent gets to the top of the queue there kid is then delivered to there car.
