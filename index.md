# The Purpose of Pick Up Pal
Pick Up Pals (PUP) is a app that streamlines schoolâ€™s child pick up systems by making the parent/gaurdian verification system more efficient while also making child pick up more safe. PuP will save verification information of parents and gaurdians, like driver license and car information, as well as who the parent and guardian is allowed to pick up. PuP will also save a black list of individuals that can not, for one reason or another, pick kids. 

When a parent or gaurdian gets in line to pick up there kids, they open PuP and select which kids (of the ones they are allowed to pick up) they are picking up today. PuP will then generate a QR code on there device. A teacher will then scan the parents QR code. Once scanned the teachers device will pull up the parent/gaurdians information and verify the person is who they say they are. The Teacher will then press a button that puts the parent in the bottom of the queue. Once the parent gets to the top of the queue there kid is then delivered to there car.


# Why Pick Up Pal is needed
We believe that Pick Up Pal is crucial because school pick up are a traffic nightmare and cause a massive inconvience for the surrouding neighborhoods. By implementing a more efficient system, we can eliminate traffic jams around a school, as well as allow parents an easier time picking up their child.


# Pick Up Pals Target Clients and Users
Our Target clients and users are schools and the parents associated with the schools as well. We will be providing the schools with the technology and helping them integrate the system within their current infastructure in order to allow a more efficent Pick Up Service. Through this manner, We hope that the after school experience and school parent interaction will be more concise.
