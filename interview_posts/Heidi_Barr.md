Current systems:

Before they have tags with the students name which has security issueses with forgeing

Now tags have numbers which is tied to the student but the tags numbers still can be forreged 

One person inputs numbers on a tag, Then the teachers watching the kids has a laptop that reads the out which kid that number is tied to

ideas:

Qr code to scan to pick up the kid

Tracking the location so they can only say what kids they are close

Have different warning signs for the teachers side that flags information that does not match or if the teacher belevies the person is not fit to take the student home. (like a green flag yellow flag and red flag)

Issues or edge cases to consider:

Emergency clause(for possible emergency and needs to be anyone at just incase)

Data consumption for the app for people that have data restrictions

Back up plan for internet goes down
