# This Page will contain all of the Mock Designs that we implement in order to keep a time line of the Designs we consider.

### This Design is for the Screen where the Parent would be selecting which student they would be picking up for that day. This desing allows us to gain a better understanding of what we should expect the parent to see along with allowing us to try and see what improvements we could make to the design and software.
