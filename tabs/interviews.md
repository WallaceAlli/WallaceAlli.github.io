### Interview 1
**Good afternoon How does your after school child pick up process at your elementary school**

_Of course ur after-school pick-up procedures are designed to ensure the safety and smooth transition of students from the classroom to their parents or guardians. At the end of the school day we have designated areas where parents line up to collect their children_
**How do parents or guardians notify the school who is allowed to pick up their child**
We ask parents to provide us with a list of approved individuals who can pick up their child at the beginning of the school year if someone new needs to pick up a child we require written permission or a phone call ahead of time to ensure we have the correct information and can verify their identity
**What happens once a parent arrives for pick-up**
When a parent arrives our staff members stationed at the pick-up area help ensure a smooth process
They check the pick-up list and verify the identity of the person collecting the child
Once verified they call the child's name over a loudspeaker and the child is escorted to the designated pick-up area
**How do you handle situations when someone not on the approved list arrives to pick up a child**
If someone not on the approved list arrives we do not release the child to them without proper verification
We will contact the parents or guardians to confirm the situation and if needed we can involve the school administration to security to resolve any issues
**Do you have any tips or suggestions you have for parents to make the process smoothe**
Absolutely communication is key parents should make sure the school has up-to-date contact information and a list of approved individuals for pick-up
They should also notify the school of any changes in their child's after-school routine and be prepared to show identification when picking up their child
**Have you encountered any problems with the current system**
Yes traffic is a big factor in slowing down the process as well as parents who make last minute changes to pick as it throws a wrench into the normal pick up procedures
If parents dont inform us of changes in pick up then it leads to verification issues
Thank you for yout time
