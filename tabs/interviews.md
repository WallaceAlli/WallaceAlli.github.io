### Interview 1
#
**Good afternoon How does your after school child pick up process at your elementary school?**

>Of course ur after-school pick-up procedures are designed to ensure the safety and smooth transition of students from the classroom to their parents or guardians. At the end of the school day we have designated areas where parents line up to collect their children.

**How do parents or guardians notify the school who is allowed to pick up their child?**

>We ask parents to provide us with a list of approved individuals who can pick up their child at the beginning of the school year if someone new needs to pick up a child we require written permission or a phone call ahead of time to ensure we have the correct information and can verify their identity.

**What happens once a parent arrives for pick-up?**

>When a parent arrives our staff members stationed at the pick-up area help ensure a smooth process. They check the pick-up list and verify the identity of the person collecting the child. Once verified they call the child's name over a loudspeaker and the child is escorted to the designated pick-up area.

**How do you handle situations when someone not on the approved list arrives to pick up a child?**

>If someone not on the approved list arrives we do not release the child to them without proper verification. We will contact the parents or guardians to confirm the situation and if needed we can involve the school administration to security to resolve any issues.

**Do you have any tips or suggestions you have for parents to make the process smoother?**

>Absolutely communication is key parents should make sure the school has up-to-date contact information and a list of approved individuals for pick-up. They should also notify the school of any changes in their child's after-school routine and be prepared to show identification when picking up their child

**Have you encountered any problems with the current system?**

>Yes traffic is a big factor in slowing down the process as well as parents who make last minute changes to pick as it throws a wrench into the normal pick up procedures. If parents dont inform us of changes in pick up then it leads to verification issues

**Thank you for your time**

### Interview 2
#
**Good afternoon, How many children do you have in elementary school?**

>I have two children who attend Degan Elementry.

**Can you tell me a bit about the after-school child pick-up process at your children's school?**

>Certainly, At Degan the after-school child pick-up process is pretty well-organized. When the school day ends parents arrive at the designated pick-up area we are required to display a car tag with our child's name and grade for identification.

**How do you find the communication between the school and the parents regarding pick-up changes or updates?**

>Communication is not the best. Degan does not do a good job of informing the parents about the changes in there system to do external factors like weather.

**Can you tell me if you've ever encountered any challenges or issues with the after-school child pick-up process?**

>Yes there was one incident that I remember clearly from a year ago. It was a rather hectic day first day of classes and the staff miss read my tag and grabbed the wrong kid.

**What did the staff do to resolve the issue?**

>After a confusing 20 ish minutes where the staff was asking me a bunch of security questions the they finally was able to bring out my kids.

**Thank you for your time today**




### Interview 3
#
**Good afternoon, could you tell me how many children you have in elementary school?**

>I have an 8 year old son in the 3rd grade.

**Could you tell me about how the school handles after school pick up?**

>Yea so I arrived at the school at the end of the day and enter the pick up line. I put my pick up tag on my review mirror and when I get to the pick up spot the teachers read the tag check my id and grab my son and head home.

**Have you had any negative experience with the pick up system?**

>Yes one day when pulled up to the pick up spot I provided the staff with my ID and was told that I was not in there system to pick up my child.

**What did you and the staff do next?**

>I tried to explain to them that there must be some mistake and that I was my sons mother. I asked to speak with the principal and after around 10 minutes the principal was brought over. Apparently there was some sort of mix up and my information was entered in wrong. After some more verification questions they brought over my son who told them that I was in fact his mother.

**Did the pick up line continue while things were being sorted out?**

>While I was waiting for the principal to come the line was not moving as they were trying to resolve the issue, when she finally came over she had me go to the teacher parking and walk into the front office to handle the verification stuff.

**Well that is all I have thank you for your time today**




### Interview 4
#
**Good afternoon, could you please tell me about how your child pick up line works?**

>Of course at the start of the year we assign each parents is given a tag that proves who they are ment to pick up. When parents arrive for pick-up they present their tag to us and we grab the corresponding students and escort them to their parent.

**What are the challenges or short comings that you have encountered with this system?**

>While our child carline goes smoothly most of the time there have been instances where communication either between the staff or the parents falls apart. On the off chance of an emergency it can take us a while get things sorted and address the problem quickly. If a parent is late to pick up there child we have to sit wait for a while after a while we call the parents but that does not mean if we get no response then we just have to wait. Also if a family is having a problem and needs some one else to pick up there kid in the line then they also need to hand over there tag or call the front office to inform us about the the adjusted pick up plan. It cause quite a headache for us when some one tries to pick up a child and we dont have any information saying that they are allowed to or not.

**You were talking earlier about emergency what sort of emergencies are we talking about?**

>Yea so if there is severe weather outside or the school is in lockdown for what ever reason we have to adjust the way we do the carline. For example if its heavily raining outside and we are in a flood then we have a harder time checking tags of vehicles so we ask the parent to scroll down there window and so we can read the tag and then grab the kid from inside to bring to the car.

**Thats all the questions I had thank you for your time today**




### Interview 5
#
**Good evening, To get started can you tell me how the pick up line system works?**

>Certainly I'd be happy to explain. At the start of the year we give out colored tags that have the students last name on them as well as a list of each person is allowed to pick up the student. When the parent pulls up to pick up their kids we check there tag and their drivers license to check if there name is on the back of the tag. Then we go grab the student from the gym where they are all are and take them to the car. When a parent is picking up multiple children then we have to check each one of the tags and verify that the parents name is on the back of the tag. Overall the line runs smoothly albeit slowly its much more secure than what we were doing a couple of years ago though.

**How did the car line function earlier?**

>Yea so when we started to open back up from covid we had given out tags for parents to put on there review mirrors those tags had the students name on them and when they pulled into line we looked at all the tags a car had hanging on a review mirror and escorted those students to that car. However we had a case where a parent who had lost custody there kid was able to take a kid home with him because he made a fake tag and hung it on the mirror. Because of that case we changed the way we do our carline

**Iâ€™m sorry to hear that, have you had any problems with the new system outside of it being slower?**

>Yea there have been a couple of times when a parent is unable to pick up there kids so they send some one else but that person is not on the back of the card so we end up having to call the parents to make sure that is alright

**Thats all the questions I have thank you for your time today**
