>In the era of our sovereign 2023, on this gloomy eve of September 22nd, the Elders convened beneath the shrouded canopy of ancient wisdom to deliberate and craft the Scrolls of Software Requirements. In this mystical conclave, we delved into the heart of our SRS manuscript, dissecting its arcane secrets with meticulous care. Amidst the flickering candlelight, we wove a tapestry of intricate details, illuminating the very essence of our quest. A profound revelation, like the tolling of a death knell, reverberated through our gathering, unveiling the sacred tapestry of future timelines and the imperious demands they bring forth for our sacred undertaking.

>Our group met up once again on Saturday in ordrer to complete the SRS and make progress on the Presentation due Monday. During this meeting we complete the majority of the SRS. We awnsered questions that we had yesterday. Questions such as what type of functions would exist in our system and how we could best represent them in order to meet our system requirements. We also decided on what slides each team member would be presenting in order to make our presentation on Monday more streamlined and consistent. Overall, It was a productive meeting and we awnsered questions we came into the meeting knowing we had to awnser while also leaving with quality questions and jobs to cover for the next meeting.

>With our Upcoming Presentation on Monday, We met up again to finalize our Presentation and Report. We completed the SRS and tried to go through it as if we were someone completely new to the idea in order to judge how well it expands and explains our project. We than took turns presenting the Presentation to see what we could improve or do better for Monday. Another important factor we implemented was to upload the Interviews that we had all completed onto the Website in order to log them and place the information in a location we can quickly access. Our Team Leader Thomas even went through the task of creating a Mock design of what our Application could potentially look at which we will also upload to the Website. We than put everything together and uploaded it to Blackboard to be submitted.

>We decided to meet up today in order to get a greater understanding of our future plans for the Stage 2 of the project. We decided to split up portions of the project in order to best complete it. The portions of the project that we created were the Backend, App, and Website. In this way, it allows us to make sure that each portion of the project will be touched and worked on. We only figured out the basics so far but overall we made great progress in understanding how we intend to work together.


### October 13, 2023
>On Friday the team was required to attend the capstone class in order to meet with the Professor in order to reorganize and explain our progress. During that meeting, we discussed the information and feedback we obtained from presenting to the Board of the College of Engineering. Feedback such as worrying about legal requirements in terms of privacy along with potentially implementing a camera to scan car license plates. The result of that conversation was for Thomas, the team leader, to plan to do research on legislation and privacy laws in Texas where we plan to first launch our application. Another important idea that was brought up was how woud we handle schools having poor wifi along with some potential regions having bad connnectivity. To solve this problem, we have decided to potentially implement local caching in order to save the important information onto the users application.
