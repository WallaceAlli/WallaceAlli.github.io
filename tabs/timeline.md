## This File will hold the time line for our project which we will update on a constant basis

>We met up in the library in order to be able to go over the Software requirement report. We broke down the report into parts and each member took it upon themselves to complete portions of the porject. For some part, We had to work together because of how they tied into one another or there was a situation where one person didnt understand what the report was asking form. We than create a time line for which we wanted the portions to be done while also planning for our next meeting

>Our group met up once again on Saturday in ordrer to complete the SRS and make progress on the Presentation due Monday. During this meeting we complete the majority of the SRS. We awnsered questions that we had yesterday. Questions such as what type of functions would exist in our system and how we could best represent them in order to meet our system requirements. We also decided on what slides each team member would be presenting in order to make our presentation on Monday more streamlined and consistent. Overall, It was a productive meeting and we awnsered questions we came into the meeting knowing we had to awnser while also leaving with quality questions and jobs to cover for the next meeting.

>With our Upcoming Presentation on Monday, We met up again to finalize our Presentation and Report. We completed the SRS and tried to go through it as if we were someone completely new to the idea in order to judge how well it expands and explains our project. We than took turns presenting the Presentation to see what we could improve or do better for Monday. Another important factor we implemented was to upload the Interviews that we had all completed onto the Website in order to log them and place the information in a location we can quickly access. Our Team Leader Thomas even went through the task of creating a Mock design of what our Application could potentially look at which we will also upload to the Website. We than put everything together and uploaded it to Blackboard to be submitted.

>We decided to meet up today in order to get a greater understanding of our future plans for the Stage 2 of the project. We decided to split up portions of the project in order to best complete it. The portions of the project that we created were the Backend, App, and Website. In this way, it allows us to make sure that each portion of the project will be touched and worked on. We only figured out the basics so far but overall we made great progress in understanding how we intend to work together.

>On Friday the team was required to attend the capstone class in order to meet with the Professor in order to reorganize and explain our progress. During that meeting, we discussed the information and feedback we obtained from presenting to the Board of the College of Engineering. Feedback such as worrying about legal requirements in terms of privacy along with potentially implementing a camera to scan car license plates. The result of that conversation was for Thomas, the team leader, to plan to do research on legislation and privacy laws in Texas where we plan to first launch our application. Another important idea that was brought up was how woud we handle schools having poor wifi along with some potential regions having bad connnectivity. To solve this problem, we have decided to potentially implement local caching in order to save the important information onto the users application.

### October 29,2023
>We met up today in order to be able to finish the Stage 2 Software Design specifications. We had all been working on our specific parts individually but it was time to put things together and go over everything in order to assure correct formating and consistency. We discuss how we intended to present our presentation along with our plans for the future as well. We also went over the models that we created, fixing them up in order to make sure that they looked up to par and consistent with our project.
