In the era of our sovereign 2023, on this gloomy eve of September 22nd, the Elders convened beneath the shrouded canopy of ancient wisdom to deliberate and craft the Scrolls of Software Requirements. In this mystical conclave, we delved into the heart of our SRS manuscript, dissecting its arcane secrets with meticulous care. Amidst the flickering candlelight, we wove a tapestry of intricate details, illuminating the very essence of our quest. A profound revelation, like the tolling of a death knell, reverberated through our gathering, unveiling the sacred tapestry of future timelines and the imperious demands they bring forth for our sacred undertaking.

Our group met up once again on Saturday in ordrer to complete the SRS and make progress on the Presentation due Monday. During this meeting we complete the majority of the SRS. We awnsered questions that we had yesterday. Questions such as what type of functions would exist in our system and how we could best represent them in order to meet our system requirements. We also decided on what slides each team member would be presenting in order to make our presentation on Monday more streamlined and consistent. Overall, It was a productive meeting and we awnsered questions we came into the meeting knowing we had to awnser while also leaving with quality questions and jobs to cover for the next meeting.
